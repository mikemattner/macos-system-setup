## Credits

Thanks to [Mathias](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and his sensible defaults, as well as the [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) by Lars Kappert for bringing this all to my attention. Also checkout [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

My setup is pretty light in comparison to most of these, but if you find any value here feel free to modify for your needs.
