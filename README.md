# macos-system-setup
My system setup in most circumstances

## Prerequisites
* [Install Xcode Tools](http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html)
* [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Also, don't forget about
* [Bartender, so I can remove those pesky icons](https://www.macbartender.com/)
* [Magnet, the window manager](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)
* [Pliim, for distration free presentations](https://zehfernandes.github.io/pliim/)

## Installation
Navigate to your repo in terminal and type `source bootstrap.sh` which should automatically run you through the setup.

## Credits
Thanks to [Mathias](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and his sensible defaults, as well as the [article](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) by Lars Kappert for bringing this all to my attention. Also checkout [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

My setup is pretty light in comparison to most of these, but if you find any value here feel free to modify for your needs.
